# Biologically informed deep learning for discovery of drug targets for PIK3CA mutated breast cancers

![Project Banner](banner0.png) 
## üöÄ Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for the **BI-BRCA-Net-LLM**! This project introduces BI-BRCA-Net, a biologically informed, explainable deep learning methodology, to investigate the mechanistic differences between PIK3CA mutant and wild type breast cancer based on the recently published P-Net architecture [1]. By integrating multiomics data (including DNA copy number, gene expression levels, methylation, and gene mutations) through an explainable neural network architecture, BI-BRCA-Net leverages existing biological knowledge to validate functional interactions. It aims to identify and later to experimentally confirm the functional modules and pathways prevalent in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer [2]. The objective is to use Large Language Models (LLMs) to invent novel hypotheses on how to limit the growth of cancer cells by targeting identified pathways, validated through the suppression of critical pathway genes and evaluating their effects on cellular proliferation.

To get started, clone this repository (a modified version of Pnet) and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Paureel/BI-BRCA-NET
cd LLM-SCIGEN-BRCA
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## üöÄ Usage

1. For the biologically informed deep learning part fit your model using one of the notebooks shown in the BI-BRCA-NET repository.

2. To generate scientific ideas, simply run the following command to launch the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```



## üß© How It Works

The model is based on the Reflexion agentic workflow by Shinn et al. https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph/blob/main/examples/reflexion/reflexion.ipynb. By inputting a custom prompt, the model generates a series of potential ideas or research questions that could inspire your next scientific endeavor.

The final output is a csv file, with the following columns:

- **Hypotheses short description**: One sentence description of the hypothesis.
- **Generated Hypotheses**: Long description of the generated hypothesis.
- **Novelty**: 1-10 score on novelty.
- **What is not novel**: Description of what is not novel.
- **Missing**: What is missing from the description of the hypothesis.
- **Superfluous**: What is redundant in the description of the hypothesis.
- **Flag**: Is there anything unusual about the input?
- **References**: References from the literature.
- **Biohazard**: Is there anything dangerous in the generated hypothesis?
- **Relations to literature**: Description on how the hypothesis relates to the published papers in the field.

| PSME4-SUMO1 axis as a therapeutic target in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer                           | Hypothesis Name: PSME4 and SUMO1 Interplay in PIK3CA Mutant Breast Cancer Progression<br><br>This hypothesis proposes a novel mechanism linking PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer to altered proteasome function through PSME4 (Proteasome Activator Subunit 4) and SUMO1 (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier 1) interactions. In PIK3CA mutant breast cancer, we hypothesize that PSME4 overexpression, possibly induced by enhanced PI3K/AKT signaling, leads to increased proteasome activation [1]. Concurrently, SUMO1-mediated post-translational modifications may alter PSME4 function, affecting its proteasome-activating capabilities [2].<br><br>This PSME4-SUMO1 axis could contribute to cancer progression by modulating the degradation of tumor suppressors or cell cycle regulators. The involvement of CASP8 (caspase 8) suggests a potential impact on apoptotic pathways, while alterations in proteasome function may affect antigen processing and presentation, influencing immune responses in the tumor microenvironment [3].<br><br>Therapeutically, this hypothesis suggests targeting PSME4 or the SUMOylation process as potential treatments for PIK3CA mutant breast cancers. Inhibitors of PSME4 or SUMO-activating enzymes could be developed and tested in combination with PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors for synergistic effects [4].<br><br>In-silico and in-vitro validation recommendations include analyzing TCGA breast cancer data to correlate PSME4 and SUMO1 expression with PIK3CA mutation status, performing proteomic studies to identify SUMOylation patterns of PSME4 in PIK3CA mutant cell lines, and assessing proteasome activity and immune responses in the presence of PSME4 or SUMOylation inhibitors.<br><br>This hypothesis is novel in its exploration of the PSME4-SUMO1 axis in PIK3CA mutant breast cancers, integrating proteasome regulation, post-translational modifications, and oncogenic signaling. The complexity lies in unraveling the intricate interplay between these cellular processes and their collective impact on cancer progression and immune responses, offering new perspectives for targeted therapies in breast cancer treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | 8       | While the overall hypothesis is novel, the concept of targeting the proteasome in cancer is not entirely new, as proteasome inhibitors are already used in some cancer treatments.

Potential for Prevention:<br><br>\- Preclinical studies suggest that short-term PI3K inhibition with alpelisib may prevent breast cancer development in high-risk individuals.<br>\- Alpelisib has shown promise in slowing early lesion expansion and preventing cancer formation in mouse models.<br><br>6\. Considerations for HER2+ Breast Cancer:<br><br>\- In HER2-positive breast cancer, PIK3CA mutations are associated with lower pathologic complete response rates to neoadjuvant therapy with pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.<br><br>These findings highlight the importance of comprehensive genetic testing for PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer patients and suggest that alpelisib may have broader applications in treatment and potentially prevention strategies for breast cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| POMT2-NPC1L1 axis in lipid metabolism dysregulation of PIK3CA mutant breast cancer                | Hypothesis Name: POMT2-NPC1L1 Axis in Lipid Metabolism Dysregulation of PIK3CA Mutant Breast Cancer<br><br>This hypothesis proposes a novel interplay between POMT2-mediated O-mannosylation and NPC1L1-dependent lipid metabolism in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer. PIK3CA mutations may alter POMT2 activity, leading to aberrant O-mannosylation of NPC1L1, a key cholesterol transporter. This post-translational modification could affect NPC1L1's stability, localization, or function, disrupting cellular lipid homeostasis [1].<br><br>The presence of both POMT2_cna and NPC1L1_cna as significant features in the model, along with pathways related to lipid metabolism, supports this hypothesis. Altered lipid metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, and PIK3CA mutations are known to rewire metabolic pathways [2]. The dysregulation of O-mannosylation and subsequent impact on NPC1L1 function could contribute to the metabolic adaptations that support the growth and survival of PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells.<br><br>Therapeutically, this hypothesis suggests a dual-targeting approach: inhibiting POMT2 to disrupt aberrant O-mannosylation, while simultaneously modulating NPC1L1 activity. This could potentially synergistically target PIK3CA mutant breast cancers [3].<br><br>In-silico and in-vitro validation recommendations:<br>1\. Analyze correlation between POMT2 and NPC1L1 expression/copy number alterations in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer datasets.<br>2\. Perform glycoproteomics to identify O-mannosylation sites on NPC1L1 in PIK3CA mutant vs. wild-type breast cancer cells.<br>3\. Assess the impact of POMT2 knockdown/inhibition on NPC1L1 function and lipid metabolism in breast cancer cell lines.<br>4\. Evaluate the efficacy of combined POMT2 and NPC1L1 inhibition in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer models.<br><br>This hypothesis uniquely connects PIK3CA mutations, O-mannosylation, and lipid metabolism through the POMT2-NPC1L1 axis, offering a new perspective on metabolic rewiring in breast cancer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | 8       | The concept of targeting metabolic pathways in cancer is not entirely new, but the specific POMT2-NPC1L1 axis in PIK3CA mutant breast cancer appears novel.                                                                                                                                                  | The hypothesis could benefit from more detailed discussion of potential feedback mechanisms between lipid metabolism and PI3K signaling. Additionally, it lacks consideration of how this axis might interact with other significant features identified in the model, such as CASP8 and FURIN. | The mention of specific inhibitors or drugs might be premature without more direct evidence linking this axis to breast cancer progression. | The hypothesis is based on real gene names and pathways identified in the model, and the reasoning appears sound given the provided features.                                                                   | PMID: 31265449, PMID: 26590714, PMID: 29347467                 | Based on the provided research abstracts, I can summarize the key findings related to PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer:<br><br>1\. Prevalence and Association with Tumor Characteristics:<br>\- PIK3CA mutations are common in breast cancer, with a mutation rate of 26.7% observed in one large cohort study.<br>\- These mutations are more frequent in:<br>¬† - Steroid hormone receptor (SHR)-positive, HER2-negative tumors (31.4%)<br>¬† - Grade 1 and Grade 2 tumors (32.8%)<br><br>2\. Impact on Prognosis and Treatment Response:<br>\- The impact of PIK3CA mutations on recurrence-free interval (RFI) and overall survival (OS) is heterogeneous.<br>\- In SHR-positive breast cancers:<br>¬† - There's a trend towards impaired RFI in patients with PIK3CA mutations.<br>¬† - A significantly detrimental prognostic impact was observed in SHR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers treated with aromatase inhibitors alone.<br>\- In SHR-negative breast cancers:<br>¬† - PIK3CA mutations were insignificantly associated with improved RFI.<br><br>3\. Response to HER2-Targeted Therapy:<br>\- In HER2-positive breast cancers, PIK3CA mutations are associated with a lower pathologic complete response (pCR) rate to neoadjuvant therapy with pyrotinib and trastuzumab plus chemotherapy.<br>\- Patients with wild-type PIK3CA had a significantly higher pCR rate compared to those with mutated PIK3CA (80.8% vs. 26.3%).<br><br>4\. Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications:<br>\- PIK3CA oncogenic gain-of-function (GOF) mutations can cooperate with CBFB loss-of-function (LOF) mutations to promote breast tumor progression.<br>\- This cooperation leads to dysregulation of mitochondrial translation and metabolic reprogramming, including:<br>¬† - Defective oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS)<br>¬† - The Warburg effect<br>¬† - Autophagy-mitophagy addiction<br>\- The study suggests a potential for combining autophagy and PI3K inhibitors as a precision medicine approach for breast cancers with these mutation profiles.<br><br>5\. Treatment Considerations:<br>\- Estrogen deprivation therapy (aromatase inhibitors) may be less effective in cases with PIK3CA mutations.<br>\- The findings provide a rationale for developing new combination therapies and personalized treatment strategies based on PIK3CA mutation status.<br><br>These findings highlight the importance of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer biology, prognosis, and treatment response. They also suggest potential avenues for targeted therapies and combination approaches in precision medicine for breast cancer patients.                                                                                                                          |
